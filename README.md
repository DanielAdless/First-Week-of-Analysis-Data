# Data Cleansing

Data clearing, also known as data cleaning or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying, correcting, or removing errors and inconsistencies in data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and reliable. This is a critical step in data preparation prior to analysis or use of such data in various applications.


*Data clearing is an important process in data management that has a number of significant benefits:*

• Improved Data Accuracy: Clean data has a high level of accuracy. Eliminating errors and mismatches in data, such as typing errors, missing values, or duplicate data, helps to ensure that the data reflects the actual state. This makes data more reliable in decision making.

• Improving Analysis Quality: Clean and accurate data helps prevent erroneous analysis and produce more accurate results. Decisions made based on high-quality data are more likely to produce better results.

• Minimizing Legal Risks: Accurate and clean data can also help organizations minimize legal risks. Data errors in terms of payroll, taxes, or other legal drops can cause serious legal problems. With clean data, the risk of such errors is reduced.

• Increased Productivity: When data is clean and accessible, data users, such as analysts and decision makers, can spend less time navigating and purging data manually. This increases productivity and allows more time for actual analysis.

• Operational Efficiency: In a business context, clean and accurate data can increase operational efficiency. This can aid in better inventory planning, inventory management, customer service improvement, and human resource management.
