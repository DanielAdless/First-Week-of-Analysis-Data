# Data Analytics

Data Analysis, also known as data analysis, is the process of converting raw data into useful insights, knowledge, and understanding that support decision making. Data analysis includes a number of techniques and methods used to dig up, understand, and interpret data.

**The following is a more detailed description of the analytical data:**

• Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Before conducting an analysis, the data needs to be cleaned and processed. These steps involve:

a) Data Cleansing: Identify and resolve errors, missing data, or inconsistencies in data.

b) Data Transformation: Change the format, normalization, and merge of required data.

c) Data Aggregation: Combines data into higher levels for analysis.


• Descriptive Analysis:
Descriptive analysis is used to understand data by explaining basic characteristics such as mean, median, variation, etc. It provides an initial view of the data and helps identify the pattern or trend of the beginning.

• Explorative Analysis:
Deep exploratory analysis helps to identify more complex relationships and patterns in the data. This involves the use of visualizing data such as graphs and diagrams to help understand the structure of data.


• Inferential Analysis:
Inferential analysis is used to make generalizations about populations based on data samples. This involves using statistics to draw conclusions from data, such as hypothesis testing or confidence interval estimation.


• Predictive Analysis:
Predictive analysis is used to make predictions or estimates based on historical data. This includes the use of machine learning algorithms and techniques such as regression, clustering, or classification to predict future outcomes.

• Prescriptive Analysis:
Prescriptive analysis is used to provide recommendations for actions that should be taken based on the results of the analysis. It can help in decision-making and planning.

• Data Visualization:
Data visualization is an important component of analytical data. This involves creating charts and visualizations that facilitate communication of analysis results to stakeholders.

• Result Implementation:
Data analysis results should be applied in an appropriate business context or situation. This may involve implementing changes in business processes, product development, or strategic decision making.


















# Data Cleansing

Data clearing, also known as data cleaning or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying, correcting, or removing errors and inconsistencies in data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and reliable. This is a critical step in data preparation prior to analysis or use of such data in various applications.


**Data clearing is an important process in data management that has a number of significant benefits:**

• Improved Data Accuracy: Clean data has a high level of accuracy. Eliminating errors and mismatches in data, such as typing errors, missing values, or duplicate data, helps to ensure that the data reflects the actual state. This makes data more reliable in decision making.

• Improving Analysis Quality: Clean and accurate data helps prevent erroneous analysis and produce more accurate results. Decisions made based on high-quality data are more likely to produce better results.

• Minimizing Legal Risks: Accurate and clean data can also help organizations minimize legal risks. Data errors in terms of payroll, taxes, or other legal drops can cause serious legal problems. With clean data, the risk of such errors is reduced.

• Increased Productivity: When data is clean and accessible, data users, such as analysts and decision makers, can spend less time navigating and purging data manually. This increases productivity and allows more time for actual analysis.

• Operational Efficiency: In a business context, clean and accurate data can increase operational efficiency. This can aid in better inventory planning, inventory management, customer service improvement, and human resource management.
